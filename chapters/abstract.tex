This report presents a comprehensive account of the implementation and performance testing process conducted on a web application that emulates the IMDb website\footnote[1]{https://www.imdb.com/}.

The report begins with an overview of the system implementation, in which the technologies utilised are outlined. Subsequently, a theoretical analysis of the queueing system network is presented, in which the implemented system is characterised.
The load test conducted on the system will be subjected to a thorough examination, including an analysis of its theoretical and empirical findings.

In conclusion, a potential architectural solution is evaluated for its potential to enhance the scalability of the tested system.

It should be noted that the implementation of the system, along with all automated programs and scripts referenced in this report, is fully documented and accessible on the GitHub repository\footnote[2]{https://github.com/danieljaderpellattiero/unive-imdb}.
